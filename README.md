# Algonquin Words and Cards Game
## Algonquin Words
Most Indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered, and indigenous peoples are fighting for the survival of their language and culture. Indigenous languages are an integral part of Indigenous identity and Canada’s cultural identity. An essential component of Indigenous decolonization and em- powerment is the protection and enhancement of their heritage language. Moreover, research reveals that “children not only learn better in their own heritage language as opposed to one of the societally dominant languages, but also develop a more positive and healthier view of themselves.”

There are nine Indigenous languages still used in Quebec: Montagnais, Naskapi, Inuktitut, Cree, Algo- nquin, Atikamekw, Mohawk, Abenaki, and Mi’kmaq. For this question we will write a program that allows us to retrieve the pronunciation of an Algonquin word. For the purpose of the assignment we might simplify some of the language, but you can find additional information on the Algonquin language here: http://www.native-languages.org/algonquin.htm

**Consonants**

There are 15 consonants in the language. Most of them are pronounced like the English version. There are only two exceptions we need to handle.
